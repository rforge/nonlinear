Description: The nonlinearTseries package provides functions for nonlinear time
             series analysis. This package permits the estimation of the 
             most-used nonlinear statistics/algorithms including generalized correlation dimension,
             information dimension, largest Lyapunov exponent, sample entropy and
             Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), among others. Basic routines
             for surrogate data testing are also included. Part of this work was based on the 
             book "Nonlinear time series analysis" by Holger Kantz and Thomas Schreiber.
